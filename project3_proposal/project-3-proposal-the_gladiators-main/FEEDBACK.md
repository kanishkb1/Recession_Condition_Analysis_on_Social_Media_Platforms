# COMMENTS

1. Format doesn't look right. Please add the original file (not PDF) of your proposal to your repository. E.g., if it was a word doc, please upload the `docx` file.
2. Unclear to me what the parameters you are going to vary in your interactive plots are. You say the data will be used to filter things, but what data?

# ANSWERS TO ABOVE QUESIONS

We are going to assess the three parameters are as follows- 
1. Keyword analysis (Wordcloud) 
2. Word-frequency analysis
3. Sentimental score analysis 

This parameter will change according to the the date range given by the user. 

# GRADE

Current: 90

If answer above questions, then 100

# DEMO

Was running on VM with correct host binding from start of demo (style points bonus)

3 plots (word cloud, sentiment analysis, word frequency) for _each_ data source.

Date slider that allows you to show the last N days of data.


## GRADE

* a README file in the format specified for Project 1.

* There is some kind of reachable demo that shows two analyses from Project 2. Interactivity not required.
  - 60
* At least one analysis allows varying at least one parameter.
  - 10
* At least two analyses allows varying at least one parameter.
